## Hi, welcome to my first-ever website!
### I'm really into police boxes and I've been documenting them for the past 9 months. Welcome to my journey :) 

##### About a year and a half ago I bought a book about police boxes at Typewronger Bookshop, and it has kickstarted this whole thing. I'm really intrigued by the premise that police boxes can be repurposed to become spaces for community and engagement so I've started documenting the existing police boxes in Edinburgh.

#### How do I navigate this map?
+ Every pin represents a police box and they have been colour coded depending on their status:
  + Light green = this police box is part of the book's reference and I've already logged it in my journal
  + Dark green = this police box is **not** part of the book's reference, but I found it (either on my own or by someone's reference) and I've already logged it in my journal.
  + Orange = this police box is part of the book's reference but I have not visited it yet, the police box may or may not exist in the location of the dropped pin.
  + Purple = I have not visited this police box yet **and it is not listed within the book's reference**. I know the box exists because I have seen it or heard about it by someone else, but I've not logged it yet.
  + Black = the police box no longer exists (rip).
+ Each police box is named after the street where they are located.
+ For more information about the book's reference see data source.
