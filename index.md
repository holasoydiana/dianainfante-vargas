## Hi, this is my first-ever website!
### I'm really into police boxes and I've been documenting them for the past 9 months. Welcome to my journey :)

#### How do I navigate this map?
+ Every pin represents a police box and they have been colour coded depending on their status:
  + Light green = this police box is part of the book's reference and I've already logged it in my journal
  + Dark green = this police box is **not** part of the book's reference, but I found it (either on my own or by someone's reference) and I've already logged it in my journal.
  + Orange = this police box is part of the book's reference but I have not visited it yet, the police box may or may not exist in the location of the dropped pin.
  + Purple = I have not visited this police box yet **but it is not listed within the book's reference**, I know the box exists because I have seen it or heard about it by someone else, but I've not logged it yet.
  + Black = the police box no longer exists (rip).
